# portfolio

## Deployed Application: 

## Description: 
In this project I created a simple portfolio page for myself. I must mention that, this is not a completed portfolio page but an ongoing project which i will be working on in the coming weeks.

I have tried to create something simple yet visually appealing for my future clients and future employers. For this reason, I prefered to implement some code related images on a dark background and to adjust the contrast ratio I used off-white font colors to reduce eye strain.

At this point, I did not add a photo to the main page which i think could be distracting. I am planning to add links to my resume and websites to introduce myself.

I aimed to create something which I would enjoy and reflect my personality. And I will continue adding some creativity to this project.
